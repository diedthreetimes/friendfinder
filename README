In order to use the android app you need the FinderLib


$ git clone https://github.com/diedthreetimes/finderlib


Add this library along with the android app to your eclipse workspace.

This project also relies on a branch of SocailAuth from Android. In particular we branch from:

URL: http://socialauth-android.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/socialauth-android

Repository UUID: 7a853004-a21d-2956-7251-024617a12917

In addition we also have our own branch of SocialAuth (java implementation)
$ git clone git@github.com:/diedthreetimes/socialauth.git
